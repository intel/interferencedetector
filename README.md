# Workload Interference Detector

## Introduction

Workload Interference Detector is a tool that leverages the Intel PMU to monitor and detect interference between workloads. Traditional PMU drivers that work in counting mode (i.e. emon, perf-stat) provide system level analysis with very little overhead. However, these drivers lack the ability to breakdown the system level metrics (CPI, cache misses, etc) at a process or application level. With ebpf, it is possible to associate the process context with the HW counter data, providing the ability to breakdown PMU metrics by process at a system level. Additionally, since ebpf runs filters in the kernel and uses perf in counting mode, this incurs very little overhead, allowing for real-time performance tracking.

## Contents:

*_procmon_*: Dumps performance metrics per process in counting mode through ebpf functionality using perf interface.

*_dockermon_*: Shows the same performance metrics but on the container level (i.e. a single record for each container-core, or a single record for each container).

*_NN_detect_*: Monitors the performance for a given workload (process or container) and compares it to a reference-signature. If any of the performance metrics deviates by an amount > a user-specified threshold (10% by default), the workload is flagged as a noisy neighbor victim and a list of workloads that likely caused the performance degradation is shown.

## Installation

1. Install all distribution-specific requirements for [compiling BCC from source.](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#source)

2. Test it using a quick example:
```
cd procmon
sudo python3 procmon.py
```

3. For monitoring docker containers, run the following command:
```
cd procmon
sudo python3 dockermon.py
```

4. For monitoring the performance of a process, run the following command:
```
cd procmon
sudo python3 NN_detect.py --pid <process-pid>  --ref_signature <processes's reference signature> --distance_ratio 0.15
```

5. For monitoring the performance of a container, run the following command:
```
cd procmon
sudo python3 NN_detect.py --cid <container id> --ref_signature <container's reference signature> --distance_ratio 0.15
```

### NN\_detect
```
usage: NN_detect.py [-h] [-p PID] [-c CID] -r REF_SIGNATURE [-d DISTANCE_RATIO]

Detect Noisy Neighbors for a given PID (process-level) or container ID (container-level).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PID, --pid PID     PID (process-level)
  -c CID, --cid CID     Container ID (container-level)
  -r REF_SIGNATURE, --ref_signature REF_SIGNATURE
                        The tool will use this signature as a baseline. All live updated signatures will be compared to the reference. Use a standalone signature (when the proccess is the
                        only process executing in the system), or any signature collected over a performance-acceptable duration.
  -d DISTANCE_RATIO, --distance_ratio DISTANCE_RATIO
                        Acceptable ratio of change in signature from reference, default is 0.1. If the distance is higher than this value, the monitored workload will flagged as a noisy
                        neigbor victim.
